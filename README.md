2. Add Slugify operation to the hook. The options are:
   - Name of the field to generate the slug from. `title` for example if you have pages collection with `title` field.
   - Path to the language code or 2 letter language code. If you specify a path such as `languages_code.code`, it will be transformed to a chain of property names as to be used in item's payload to find the language of the payload. If you don't have a language code in your item, you can just type a 2 letter language code here such as `en` but be aware that it might effect the generated slugs.
   - Name of the slug field. The name of the field in your item's payload to put the generated slug such as `slug`.
